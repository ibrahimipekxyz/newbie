"Where can I start programming?"

Actually, there is not a single answer to this question. Depending on what you want to do with the programming, you determine 
where you need to start. There are four basic ways for this to happen;

1- Mobile Programming
2- Web Programming
3- System Programming
4- Game Programming

You do not have to choose a way, you can choose all the ways and find a language according to it.There are now hundreds 
of programming languages, which one should we choose?

1) There are only 3 options for "Mobile Programming": Android, iOS or Windows Phone? I do not think it's ridiculous that the 
third one is listed on Windows Phone because it is not used much. On these platforms you can get the necessary Programs to 
start writing applications (Android Studio / xCode)

2) If you chose the "Web Programming" way, your job is simple. The languages you need to learn are: HTML - CSS 
(these are not programming languages), JavaScript and PHP. PHP can actually come in Python, Java, or any other language, 
but it's much more sensible to choose PHP with the latest releases and the accompanying documentation.
And as I said, there are a lot of languages that can be used in place of PHP, and even an advanced website can be written 
using C++ and CGI.

3) If you ask me for "system programming", I can say to you: Programming with Operating Systems, PLC programming, 
Microcontroller-PIC programming are the programs written down to the basis of the computer system. This category includes 
Assembly (Any processor architecture), C, C++, Fortran etc. languages are on the foreground.

4) Game programming is based on game motors and things called "object-based programming". Two-dimensional and 
three-dimensional computer games predict that the form of construction is slightly different. The languages that stand out for 
this category are; C++, C# (I do not recommend this, do not do it! I'm not a Microsoft slave!), JavaScript, Python, Java 
etc.. But I recommend you to not spend all your might on game programming, computer games are just to relax!
